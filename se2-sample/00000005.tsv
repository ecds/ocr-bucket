1. Go ye hum-ble pil - grim stran-ger, Thro' this world of woe,	849	1161	2222	140	
2. If your way is dark and lone- ly, He will be your guide,	865	1252	2221	115	
3. When dis-cour-aged and for - sak - en, Run to Him in pray'r,	867	1311	2252	128	
4. If you chance to find a stran-ger, Put him in the way,	873	1394	2202	107	
You may meet with many a dan-ger, Ev -'ry- where you go.	853	1993	2186	146	
He is, though so meek and low -ly, More than all be- side.	865	2085	2202	116	
Nev - er has been one o'er-tak - en, Who re- sort- ed there.	847	2159	2226	115	
Tell him how to flee the dan- ger, While it is called day.	835	2209	2240	136	
Don't for- get that God a-bove you, Hath a gra - cious heart,	823	2833	2184	136	
When the world in arms as- sail you, And your cour- age fail,	827	2924	2153	118	
When the storms of life are beat-ing, Hard up-on your head,	815	2994	2203	110	
Tell him there's a pre - cious fountain, Flow -ing free for all,	829	3063	2145	108	
He will nev - er cease to love you, Or to take your part,	849	3710	2164	137	
Let Him fight your bat - tle for you, And you will pre - vail.	866	3812	2125	103	
God will hide you, He is plead -ing, "Be ye not a - fraid."	850	3878	2163	109	
Je - sus Christ, on Cal-vary's mountain, Paid for A - dam's fall.	861	3942	2127	112	
5 Tell him that above a brother,	619	4300	999	125	
There's a Saviour's love,	755	4389	752	92	
If on earth he has no other,	690	4449	861	112	
There's a friend above.	767	4524	684	91	
If he needs your help and kindness,	680	4568	1091	124	
Don't withhold your hand,	751	4651	836	100	
Always of this be reminded,	671	4714	880	117	
He's your fellow man.	748	4791	681	108	
6 Then when Jesus comes in Glory,	1958	4295	1100	138	
On the judgement throne,	2117	4403	742	79	
In His book will be the story,	2029	4460	892	100	
All shall be made known.	2103	4540	762	80	
There above all other favors,	2039	4580	863	117	
On the golden strand,	2105	4665	658	92	
Will be placed upon your labors,	2049	4716	973	116	
For your fellow man.	2103	4803	658	95
